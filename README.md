## How to use this repo

Clone alongside `arsnova-backend`. Run `./gradlew build` to create a web archive ready for deployment. If you are using Jetty, it should already pick up all necessary files. You may whish to change the `customization.path` variable inside `arsnova-backend`'s `pom.xml` if you downloaded this repository to a different location. Make sure to restart Jetty.
